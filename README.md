This project uses Finnhub API to provide:
1. Search function where users can type in a query and select one of the stock from query result.
2. Visuals displaying stock name, detailed information, interactive graphs of stock prices on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.
3. Predict function where users can select a stock and predict its next day price using a LSTM(long short-term memory networks) model and next month price using an ARIMA(autoregressive integrated moving average) model. Limited amount of data is used to assure that users won't wait for too long.
4. Light and dark mode.
